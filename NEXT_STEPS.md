# Next Steps & Recommendations

**Date:** December 15, 2025
**Status:** Operational Excellence Phase Complete

## 🏁 Current State
The FWBer platform has reached a high level of maturity. The "Operational Excellence" roadmap items (Performance, Monitoring, Infrastructure) have been successfully implemented. The application is stable, monitored, and feature-rich.

## 🚀 Recommended Next Actions

### 1. Marketing & Growth (Non-Technical)
With the platform technically ready, the focus should shift to user acquisition.
- **SEO Optimization**: Ensure `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt` are perfectly configured for the new landing pages.
- **A/B Testing**: Experiment with different Landing Page headlines and CTAs.
- **Referral Program**: Monitor the "Wingman Bounties" system to ensure it's driving growth.

### 2. Community & Safety
- **Moderation Policies**: Define clear guidelines for the "Moderation Dashboard" operators.
- **Safety Drills**: Test the "Geo-spoofing" and "Shadow Ban" features with real scenarios to ensure they are effective but fair.

### 3. Technical Maintenance (Low Priority)
- **Dependency Updates**: Schedule a monthly review of `npm` and `composer` dependencies.
- **E2E Test Suite**: Continue to expand Cypress coverage, particularly for edge cases in the "Video Chat" and "Gift" flows.
- **Cost Optimization**: Monitor AWS/Stripe costs as traffic grows.

## 🔮 Future Feature Ideas (Q2 2026)
- **Native Mobile Apps**: Consider wrapping the PWA in Capacitor/React Native for App Store presence.
- **Advanced Matching**: Implement "Group Matching" (finding other groups to hang out with).
- **Voice/Video Dating**: Scheduled "Speed Dating" events via Video Chat.
