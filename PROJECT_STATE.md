## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Active Stack (Production)
- **Backend:** Legacy PHP 8.2+ with modern security
- **Database:** MySQL 8.0+
- **Session Management:** Secure PDO-backed sessions
- **Authentication:** Argon2ID password hashing
- **Security:** SecurityManager class (CSRF, rate limiting)
- **Profile Management:** ProfileManager class (handles 150+ fields)
- **Photo Management:** PhotoManager class (secure uploads)

### In Development (Parallel Track)
- **Backend:** Laravel 12 (fwber-backend/) - 60% complete
- **Frontend:** Next.js 15 with TypeScript (fwber-frontend/) - 60% complete

## üö® Known Issues & Risks

### Technical Issues
- ‚úÖ **FIXED:** Gender-specific data leakage (backend validation added - Oct 11)
- ‚úÖ **FIXED:** Missing field handlers in edit-profile.php (all 150+ fields now captured - Oct 11)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **MINOR:** Naming inconsistency (b_wantLooksQuirky vs Quirks) - deferred to testing

### Business Risks
1. **Launch too late:** Competitor moves, market timing shifts, developer burnout
   - Mitigation: Hard 4-week deadline (Nov 8)
2. **B2B/B2C imbalance:** No venue = no users, no users = no venue
   - Mitigation: Hyper-local pilot (1 venue + their patrons)
3. **Reputational damage:** Launch with critical bugs, bad UX, safety issues
   - Mitigation: E2E testing, beta labeling, private pilot first
