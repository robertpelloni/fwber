Please review the md files and state of the project, summarize it, and get back to me. I would also like to condense and simplify this project as much as possible, so please take that into consideration. I will be using several IDEs, IDE plugins, and CLI tools for the various major LLMs to work on this project, including Cursor, WebStorm, Github Copilot, Cline, Gemini, Claude, Grok, JetBrains AI, OpenAI Codex, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Github Copilot CLI, Grok CLI, etc. I am also using Serena MCP. Ideally I could get you all to interoperate together somehow to bounce ideas off each other and check each others' work, including myself in the process at times. Please advise on what a good way to do that might be, perhaps MCP configurations between each other, or an AI log file that you all use to communicate, etc. If this approach is successful I will be using it for several more projects, so I would like to come up with an effective and efficient workflow. Thank you very much!
