I am currently evaluating all the major AI models, CLI tools, IDEs, IDE plugins, and MCP servers. My ultimate goal is to configure them all together in order to create a super powerful mega AI which communicates between several models and orchestrates multiple models and tools together in parallel, in order to debate, brainstorm, and assign tasks and work as a team maybe with subagents, hopefully in order to produce better ideas and results. Currently I am starting with codex CLI, please check its configuration. The config files are listed in the nppsession file. I believe it is having MCP timeout errors due to environment variable whitelisting. Please try to correct this in the config file and Cursor's settings. Codex seems to want to use WSL, which is fine but I need help configuring it in that case. Powershell and cmd are also both fine. I would then like to move on to more CLI tools, trying to make sure that each CLI tool and IDE has access to as many models as possible, that they all are configured with the same MCP servers and tools, and that they all work if possible, and they are able to call out to all other major models in several ways and use the other CLI tools, and also utilize all the MCP servers and tools when and where useful. Ultimately I want to use this super development AI team to help me to complete FWBer and then move on to more projects. Please begin with codex and bypass the environment variable whitelist somehow so that it can access the tools in its config file. Please also suggest any other tools, techniques, CLI tools, IDE, model, or especially MCP server which you think would be useful at any time. Please use the web search functions available to you to research this as well.
