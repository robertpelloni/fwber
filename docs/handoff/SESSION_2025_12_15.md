# Session Handoff - December 15, 2025

## 📝 Session Summary
- **Objective**: Fix CI build errors and continue feature development.
- **Key Fix**: Resolved `no such table: user_public_keys` error in CI by force-adding the migration file `database/migrations/2025_12_13_181619_create_user_public_keys_table.php` which was previously ignored by `.gitignore`.
- **Current State**:
    - Backend Tests: **PASSING** (170+ tests).
    - Frontend Build: **PASSING**.
    - Project Phase: **Post-Launch Monitoring & Growth**.

## 🛠 Technical Context
- **Backend**: Laravel 12, SQLite (Testing), MySQL (Production).
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, Tailwind CSS.
- **AI**: `LlmManager` with drivers for OpenAI, Gemini, Claude.
- **Real-time**: Mercure Hub, WebSocket.

## 🚀 Next Steps
- **Immediate**: Implement **Automated Feedback Analysis** using LLM to categorize and analyze user feedback.
- **Future**:
    - Monitor Sentry for production issues.
    - Analyze `SlowRequest` logs.
    - Continue implementing "Viral Growth" features if any remain.

## 📂 Key Files
- `PROJECT_STATUS.md`: Detailed status of all features.
- `docs/ROADMAP.md`: High-level roadmap.
- `fwber-backend/app/Services/AiWingmanService.php`: AI logic.
- `fwber-backend/app/Http/Controllers/FeedbackController.php`: Target for next feature.

## ⚠️ Notes
- The `.gitignore` has a rule `*_keys*` which caused the migration issue. Be careful with filenames containing "keys".
