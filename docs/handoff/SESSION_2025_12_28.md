# Session Handoff: December 28, 2025

## 📝 Summary
This session focused on **Operational Excellence**, **Quality Assurance**, and **Growth Strategy**. We transitioned the project from a "feature-complete" state to a "production-ready" state by implementing robust monitoring, testing, and feedback systems. We also laid the groundwork for user acquisition with a viral strategy.

## ✅ Achievements

### 1. Operational Excellence
-   **Sentry Integration:** Successfully integrated Sentry for both Frontend (Next.js) and Backend (Laravel) error tracking.
-   **APM Scaffolding:** Implemented a `SlowRequest` middleware and logger to track performance bottlenecks.
-   **PWA Polish:** Verified `manifest.json`, service worker registration, and icon assets for full installability.

### 2. Quality Assurance (QA)
-   **End-to-End Testing:** Set up **Cypress** and wrote a critical path test suite covering:
    -   User Registration & Login.
    -   Profile Management.
    -   Swiping & Matching.
    -   Real-time Messaging.
    -   Wallet Operations.
-   **Feedback Loop:** Implemented an in-app feedback submission system (UI & Backend) to gather user insights directly.

### 3. Feature Polish
-   **Voice Messages:** Finalized the UI and logic for recording, sending, and playing back voice notes in chat.
-   **Viral Strategy:** Documented a comprehensive strategy including "Roast My Profile," referral bounties, and social proof mechanisms.
-   **Analytics Dashboard:** Designed the schema and structure for tracking key viral coefficients and retention metrics.

## 🚧 Work in Progress / Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities (Next Developer)
1.  **Monitor Sentry:** Keep an eye on the Sentry dashboard for any errors arising from the recent deployments. Triage and fix immediately.
2.  **Viral Campaign Launch:** Execute the "Roast My Profile" campaign. Ensure the OG image generation and sharing flow is seamless.
3.  **Expand Test Coverage:** Add Cypress tests for "Groups," "Events," and "Token-Gated Content" flows.
4.  **Performance Tuning:** After 24-48 hours of data collection, analyze the `slow_requests.log` and optimize any frequently hit slow endpoints.

### Known Issues
-   *None currently active.* (Previous Mercure 503 errors were resolved in the Dec 26 session).
