## Rollback Plan

### Preparation

- [ ] Previous version tagged and accessible
- [ ] Database backup from just before deployment

### Rollback Triggers

Consider rollback if:
- Critical security vulnerability discovered
- Data loss or corruption occurring
- Service completely unavailable
- Error rate exceeds 5%
- Database migrations cannot be reversed safely
- User data exposed or at risk

### Rollback Procedure

1. **Stop Deployment**
   ```bash
   # Stop auto-deployments if enabled
   ```

2. **Revert Frontend**
   ```bash
   # Vercel/Netlify: Use platform rollback feature
   # Or redeploy previous version
   git checkout v1.0.0
   npm run build
   npm run deploy
   ```

3. **Revert Backend**
   ```bash
   git checkout v1.0.0
   composer install --no-dev
   php artisan down # Put site in maintenance mode
   php artisan migrate:rollback # If migrations were run
   php artisan config:cache
   php artisan route:cache
   php artisan view:cache
   sudo systemctl restart php8.2-fpm
   sudo systemctl restart nginx
   php artisan up # Bring site back online
   ```

4. **Verify Rollback**
   - [ ] Application accessible
   - [ ] Critical functions working
   - [ ] No data loss
   - [ ] Monitoring shows stability

5. **Communication**
   - [ ] Notify team of rollback
   - [ ] Update status page
   - [ ] Communicate with users if necessary
   - [ ] Post-mortem scheduled
