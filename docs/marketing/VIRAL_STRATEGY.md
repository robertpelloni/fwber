# VIRAL GROWTH STRATEGY

## 1. Executive Summary

FWBer's growth strategy relies on product-led viral loops rather than paid acquisition. By leveraging "social currency" (reputation, humor, status), we incentivize users to share FWBer content naturally.

**Core Philosophy:** "Come for the Roast, Stay for the Community."

## 2. The Core Viral Loops

### A. The "Roast" Loop (High Velocity / Top of Funnel)
*   **Hook:** Curiosity & Humor. "What does AI think of my dating profile?"
*   **Action:** User uploads a profile screenshot or enters text.
*   **Variable Reward:** A funny, slightly mean, shareable AI "Roast" image.
*   **Investment/Share:** User shares the image on IG Stories/Twitter with a deep link.
*   **Conversion:** Viewers click to "Roast Themselves" or "Defend this User."

### B. The "Vouch" Loop (Social Proof / Mid-Funnel)
*   **Hook:** Need for Trust & Status. "I'm not a creep, let me prove it."
*   **Action:** User sends a "Vouch Link" to friends (even non-users).
*   **Variable Reward:** "Verified Safe," "Fun," or "Hot" badges on their profile.
*   **Investment:** Friends visit the landing page to vote.
*   **Conversion:** Friends are prompted to "Claim Your Own Vouch Profile" after voting.

### C. The Referral Loop (Incentive / Bottom Funnel)
*   **Hook:** Greed/Utility. "I need tokens to see who liked me."
*   **Action:** User shares a unique referral code.
*   **Reward:** Both parties get +50 Tokens.
*   **Investment:** New user signs up and completes onboarding.
