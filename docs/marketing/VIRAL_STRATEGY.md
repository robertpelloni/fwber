# VIRAL GROWTH STRATEGY

## 1. Executive Summary

FWBer's growth strategy relies on product-led viral loops rather than paid acquisition. By leveraging "social currency" (reputation, humor, status), we incentivize users to share FWBer content naturally.

**Core Philosophy:** "Come for the Roast, Stay for the Community."

## 2. The Core Viral Loops

### A. The "Roast" Loop (High Velocity / Top of Funnel)
*   **Hook:** Curiosity & Humor. "What does AI think of my dating profile?"
*   **Action:** User uploads a profile screenshot or enters text.
*   **Variable Reward:** A funny, slightly mean, shareable AI "Roast" image.
*   **Investment/Share:** User shares the image on IG Stories/Twitter with a deep link.
*   **Conversion:** Viewers click to "Roast Themselves" or "Defend this User."

### B. The "Vouch" Loop (Social Proof / Mid-Funnel)
*   **Hook:** Need for Trust & Status. "I'm not a creep, let me prove it."
*   **Action:** User sends a "Vouch Link" to friends (even non-users).
*   **Variable Reward:** "Verified Safe," "Fun," or "Hot" badges on their profile.
*   **Investment:** Friends visit the landing page to vote.
*   **Conversion:** Friends are prompted to "Claim Your Own Vouch Profile" after voting.

### C. The Referral Loop (Incentive / Bottom Funnel)
*   **Hook:** Greed/Utility. "I need tokens to see who liked me."
*   **Action:** User shares a unique referral code.
*   **Reward:** Both parties get +50 Tokens.
*   **Investment:** New user signs up and completes onboarding.

## 3. Implementation Status

| Feature | Status | Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **AI Roast** | ✅ Live | Generates viral images via OpenGraph. |
| **Vouch System** | ✅ Live | "Safe/Fun/Hot" voting categories. |
| **Referral Codes** | ✅ Live | Token rewards for signups. |
| **Share to Unlock** | 🚧 Beta | Content gating mechanism. |

## 4. Metrics & KPIs

*   **Viral Coefficient (K-Factor):** Target > 1.2 (Each user brings >1.2 users).
*   **Referral Conversion:** % of share clicks that result in a signup.
*   **Social Share Rate:** % of generated Roasts that are actually shared.

## 5. Strategic Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1.  **Optimize "Roast" Landing Page:** Ensure the "Roast Me Too" CTA is dominant on shared pages.
2.  **Gamify Vouches:** Add a "Trusted Member" leaderboard to encourage collecting vouches.

### New Viral Features (Low Effort)
1.  **"Matchmaker Bounty":** Allow users to create a public "Bounty" link. "Find me a date, get 100 Tokens." If a third party sets them up (via a specific link), the matchmaker gets the tokens.
2.  **"Red Flag Checker":** A tool where users input their own quirks, and AI tells them if it's a "Beige," "Red," or "Green" flag. Highly shareable results.

## 6. Long-Term Vision

Move beyond 1:1 dating. Position FWBer as a *social reputation protocol* for the dating world. Your FWBer score (Vouches + Roast resilience) becomes your "Dating Credit Score."
