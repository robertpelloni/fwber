## Phase 2: Freeze Legacy Development (Week 2) ‚è≥

### Enforcement Rules

**ALLOWED in Legacy Code:**
- ‚úÖ Security fixes (e.g., encryption key migration)
- ‚úÖ Critical bug fixes (data corruption, crashes)
- ‚úÖ Security patches (SQL injection, XSS, CSRF)

**FORBIDDEN in Legacy Code:**
- ‚ùå New features
- ‚ùå UI improvements
- ‚ùå Code refactoring (except security-related)
- ‚ùå Database schema changes

### Code Freeze Implementation

```php
// Add to top of every legacy file:
<?php
/**
 * ‚ö†Ô∏è DEPRECATED - Legacy PHP Code
 * 
 * Status: FROZEN (bug fixes only)
 * Replacement: [Link to new implementation]
 * Deprecation Date: 2025-10-18
 * Sunset Date: 2026-04-18
 * 
 * DO NOT ADD NEW FEATURES HERE
 * See ADR 001 for migration plan
 */
```

### CI/CD Enforcement
```yaml
# .github/workflows/legacy-freeze-check.yml
name: Enforce Legacy Freeze

on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  check-legacy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check for legacy modifications
        run: |
          # Get changed files in root directory
          CHANGED=$(git diff --name-only origin/main... | grep -E '^[^/]+\.php$' || true)
          
          if [ -n "$CHANGED" ]; then
            echo "::error::Legacy PHP files modified. New features must go in fwber-backend/"
            echo "Changed files: $CHANGED"
            echo "If this is a security fix, add label: security-fix"
            exit 1
          fi
```

---

## Phase 4: Dual-Stack Operation (Weeks 3-20)

### Routing Strategy

**During Migration Period:**
```nginx
# nginx.conf or .htaccess
# Route new features to Next.js, legacy to PHP

# New stack (served by Next.js)
location /auth { proxy_pass http://localhost:3000; }
location /profile { proxy_pass http://localhost:3000; }
location /matches { proxy_pass http://localhost:3000; }
location /api/v1 { proxy_pass http://localhost:8000; } # Laravel

# Legacy stack (PHP)
location ~ \.php$ { 
    # Serve PHP files
    # Log deprecation warnings
}
```

### Session Sharing
```php
// Bridge authentication between stacks
// Laravel creates NextAuth-compatible sessions
// Legacy PHP reads from same session store
```

### Data Consistency
- Single MySQL database (shared)
- Laravel migrations manage schema
- Legacy PHP reads from same tables
- No dual writes (Laravel is source of truth)

---

## Phase 5: Monitoring & Validation (Ongoing)

### Metrics to Track

**Traffic Patterns:**
- Legacy PHP requests/day
- New stack requests/day
- Error rates (legacy vs new)
- Response times (legacy vs new)

**User Experience:**
- User complaints about features
- Bug reports (legacy vs new)
- Feature usage analytics
- A/B test results

**Technical Health:**
- Legacy code coverage (should decrease)
- New stack code coverage (should increase to 80%+)
- Security scan results
- Performance benchmarks

### Migration Milestones

| Week | Milestone | Success Criteria |
|------|-----------|------------------|
| 4 | Auth migrated | 50% of logins via NextAuth |
| 8 | Profile migrated | 50% of profile edits via new stack |
| 12 | Matches migrated | 75% of match views via new stack |
| 16 | Messaging live | 90% of messages via new stack |
| 20 | Full migration | 95% of traffic on new stack |
| 24 | Legacy sunset | 100% on new stack, legacy archived |

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Data Loss During Migration
**Mitigation:**
- Database backups before each phase
- Dual-write temporarily if needed
- Rollback procedures documented
- Gradual cutover (not big bang)

### Risk 2: User Disruption
**Mitigation:**
- Feature flags for gradual rollout
- A/B testing for new features
- Maintain legacy as fallback
- Clear communication to users

### Risk 3: Performance Regression
**Mitigation:**
- Performance benchmarks before/after
- Load testing on new stack
- Caching strategy (Redis)
- Database query optimization

### Risk 4: Team Capacity
**Mitigation:**
- Realistic timeline (6 months)
- Focus on critical path first
- Parallel work where possible
- External help if needed

---

## Success Criteria

### Technical Success
- [ ] 100% feature parity
- [ ] Zero security regressions
- [ ] Performance equal or better
- [ ] 80%+ test coverage
- [ ] Zero data loss

### Business Success
- [ ] No user complaints about migration
- [ ] Development velocity increases
- [ ] Bug rate decreases
- [ ] New features ship faster
- [ ] Technical debt reduced by 70%

### Team Success
- [ ] Developer satisfaction improves
- [ ] Onboarding time decreases
- [ ] Code review time decreases
- [ ] Clearer ownership and responsibility

---

## Rollback Plan

If critical issues arise during migration:

**Emergency Rollback (< 5 minutes):**
```bash
# Revert routing to legacy
# Disable new stack
# Monitor error logs
# Investigate issue
```

**Planned Rollback (if phase fails):**
- Maintain legacy code operational for 12 months after "completion"
- Archive but don't delete legacy code
- Keep database schema compatible
- Document lessons learned

---

## Communication Plan

### Weekly Updates
- Migration progress report
- Blocker identification
- Success metrics
- Next week priorities

### Stakeholder Communication
- Executive summary monthly
- User communication 2 weeks before each cutover
- Team standup daily during active migration
