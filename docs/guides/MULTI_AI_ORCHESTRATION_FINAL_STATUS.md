- **Status:** ✅ OPERATIONAL
- **You're using it right now!**
- **MCP Access:** Yes (100+ tools via Serena, Zen, etc.)
- **Recommendation:** Use as primary development environment

### ✅ **Gemini CLI** (WORKING)
- **Status:** ✅ OPERATIONAL  
- **Version:** 0.9.0
- **MCP Config:** Created at `C:\Users\hyper\.gemini\mcp-config.json`
- **Recommendation:** Use for alternative AI perspectives

### ❌ **Codex CLI** - BROKEN
- **Status:** ❌ CRITICAL BUG
- **Issue:** stdio transport fails for ALL MCP servers
- **Evidence:** All servers timeout at JSON-RPC handshake
- **Process Leaks:** 90+ orphaned processes  
- **Recommendation:** DO NOT USE until OpenAI fixes

### ❌ **Claude CLI** - BROKEN  
- **Status:** ❌ CRASH ON START
- **Issue:** `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'prototype')`
- **MCP Config:** Created at `C:\Users\hyper\.claude\claude.json` (for when fixed)
- **Recommendation:** Wait for Anthropic to fix

## 🚀 Working Multi-AI Orchestration Approach

### Immediate Use (Production Ready):

**Option 1: Cursor IDE Only (RECOMMENDED)**
```
You're already in Cursor IDE with full MCP access!
- Use built-in AI features
- Access all MCP servers through Serena, Zen, etc.
- No additional setup needed
```

**Option 2: Cursor IDE + Gemini CLI**
```bash
# In Cursor IDE: Primary development
# In Terminal: Alternative perspectives
gemini "Analyze this code for security issues"
gemini "Review this architecture design"
```

### Future Use (When Fixed):
- ⏳ Claude CLI (when Anthropic fixes the crash)
- ⏳ Codex CLI (when OpenAI fixes stdio transport)

## 📁 Configuration Files Created

### Working Configurations:
1. **Cursor IDE**: Already configured (built-in)
2. **Gemini CLI**: `C:\Users\hyper\.gemini\mcp-config.json` ✅
3. **Claude CLI**: `C:\Users\hyper\.claude\claude.json` (ready for when fixed)

### Archived Configurations:
4. **Codex CLI**: `C:\Users\hyper\.codex\config.toml` (broken, archived)

## 🎯 Recommended Workflow for FWBer.me

### Development Environment
```
Primary: Cursor IDE (you're in it now)
  ├─ Code editing with AI assistance
  ├─ MCP tools via Serena (20+ tools)
  ├─ MCP tools via Zen (18+ tools)
  ├─ File operations, memory, etc.
  └─ Built-in terminal

Alternative: Gemini CLI
  └─ Secondary opinions and analysis
```

### Multi-Model Consensus Pattern
```bash
# 1. Work in Cursor IDE (primary)
# 2. Get alternative perspective
gemini "Review the security implementation in security-manager.php"

# 3. Compare insights
# 4. Make informed decisions
```

## 📊 Success Metrics

- ✅ Cleaned up 90+ orphaned processes
- ✅ Consolidated 10+ redundant docs into 2 files
- ✅ Installed all 11 MCP servers globally
- ✅ Identified 2 working CLI tools (Cursor, Gemini)
- ✅ Identified 2 broken CLI tools (Codex, Claude)
- ✅ Created production-ready orchestration workflow
- ✅ Ready to proceed with FWBer.me development

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

1. **Not all MCP implementations are equal** - Cursor IDE works, CLI tools have bugs
2. **Process management is critical** - Always monitor for leaks
3. **Documentation consolidation saves time** - Single source of truth > 10 analysis docs
4. **IDE integration is most reliable** - CLI tools are immature
5. **Test early, pivot fast** - Don't waste time on broken tools

## 🚀 Next Steps for FWBer.me Development

Now that the multi-AI environment is ready, proceed with:

1. **Use Cursor IDE** for primary development
2. **Use Gemini CLI** for alternative perspectives when needed
3. **Focus on FWBer.me features** using working tools
4. **Monitor for updates** to Claude CLI and Codex CLI
5. **Leverage MCP servers** through Cursor IDE's integration

## 🎯 AI Skills and Development Methodologies

### Collaboration Skills

#### Brainstorming Ideas Into Designs
**Purpose**: Transform rough ideas into fully-formed designs through structured questioning
**Key Phases**:
1. **Understanding** - Ask questions to gather purpose, constraints, success criteria
2. **Exploration** - Propose 2-3 different approaches with trade-offs
3. **Design Presentation** - Present in 200-300 word sections for validation
4. **Design Documentation** - Write design document to `docs/plans/`
5. **Worktree Setup** - Set up isolated workspace for implementation
6. **Planning Handoff** - Create detailed implementation plan

**Core Principles**:
- One question at a time during understanding phase
- Use AskUserQuestion tool for structured choices
- Present design incrementally for validation
- Go backward when needed - flexibility over rigid progression
- Apply YAGNI ruthlessly

#### Dispatching Parallel Agents
**Purpose**: Handle multiple independent failures concurrently
**When to Use**:
- 3+ independent failures that can be investigated without shared state
- Each problem can be understood without context from others
- No shared state between investigations

**Process**:
1. **Identify Independent Domains** - Group failures by what's broken
2. **Create Focused Agent Tasks** - Each agent gets specific scope and clear goal
3. **Dispatch in Parallel** - Multiple agents work concurrently
4. **Review and Integrate** - Review summaries, verify no conflicts, integrate changes

#### Subagent-Driven Development
**Purpose**: Execute implementation plans with fresh subagent per task
**Process**:
1. **Load Plan** - Read plan file, create TodoWrite with all tasks
2. **Execute Task with Subagent** - Dispatch fresh subagent for each task
3. **Review Subagent's Work** - Dispatch code-reviewer subagent
4. **Apply Review Feedback** - Fix issues before next task
5. **Mark Complete, Next Task** - Repeat for all tasks
6. **Final Review** - Review entire implementation
7. **Complete Development** - Use finishing-a-development-branch skill

### Debugging Skills

#### Systematic Debugging
**Purpose**: Four-phase framework for understanding bugs before attempting fixes
**The Iron Law**: NO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION FIRST

**Four Phases**:
1. **Root Cause Investigation** - Read errors, reproduce, check changes, gather evidence
2. **Pattern Analysis** - Find working examples, compare against references
3. **Hypothesis and Testing** - Form single hypothesis, test minimally
4. **Implementation** - Create failing test, implement fix, verify

**Red Flags** (STOP and follow process):
- "Quick fix for now, investigate later"
- "Just try changing X and see if it works"
- "Add multiple changes, run tests"
- Proposing solutions before tracing data flow
- "One more fix attempt" (when already tried 2+)

#### Root Cause Tracing
**Purpose**: Backward tracing technique for errors deep in call stack
**Process**:
- Where does bad value originate?
- What called this with bad value?
- Keep tracing up until you find the source
- Fix at source, not at symptom

### Development Skills

#### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
**Purpose**: Write test first, watch it fail, write minimal code to pass
**The Iron Law**: NO PRODUCTION CODE WITHOUT A FAILING TEST FIRST

**Red-Green-Refactor Cycle**:
1. **RED** - Write failing test, verify it fails correctly
2. **GREEN** - Write minimal code to pass, verify it passes
3. **REFACTOR** - Clean up while keeping tests green

**Key Principles**:
- If you didn't watch the test fail, you don't know if it tests the right thing
- Write code before the test? Delete it. Start over.
- One behavior per test
- Clear test names
- Real code (no mocks unless unavoidable)

#### Writing Plans
**Purpose**: Create comprehensive implementation plans for engineers with zero codebase context
**Structure**:
- Bite-sized task granularity (2-5 minutes per step)
- Exact file paths always
- Complete code in plan (not "add validation")
- Exact commands with expected output
- DRY, YAGNI, TDD, frequent commits

#### Executing Plans
**Purpose**: Implement plans task-by-task with verification
**Process**:
1. **Load Plan** - Read plan file, understand structure
2. **Execute Task** - Implement each task following TDD
3. **Verify Task** - Run tests, check output
4. **Commit Task** - Commit with descriptive message
5. **Next Task** - Repeat until all tasks complete

### Quality Assurance Skills

#### Code Review
**Purpose**: Professional code reviews with structured feedback
**Template Structure**:
- **WHAT_WAS_IMPLEMENTED**: Summary of changes
- **PLAN_OR_REQUIREMENTS**: Original requirements
- **BASE_SHA/HEAD_SHA**: Git commit references
- **DESCRIPTION**: Task summary

**Review Categories**:
- **Strengths**: What was done well
- **Issues**: Critical/Important/Minor issues
- **Assessment**: Overall quality and readiness

#### Verification Before Completion
**Purpose**: Verify fix worked before claiming success
**Process**:
- Run full test suite
- Check for regressions
- Verify all requirements met
- Document what was fixed

### Writing and Communication Skills

#### Writing Clearly and Concisely
**Purpose**: Apply Strunk's timeless writing rules to any prose
**Key Rules**:
- Use active voice
- Put statements in positive form
- Use definite, specific, concrete language
- Omit needless words
- Keep related words together
- Place emphatic words at end of sentence

### Meta Skills

#### Using Git Worktrees
**Purpose**: Set up isolated workspaces for safe experimentation
**Process**:
1. **Directory Selection** - Choose appropriate directory
2. **Safety Verification** - Ensure no conflicts with main work
3. **Setup** - Create worktree with proper configuration
4. **Verification** - Confirm worktree is ready for use

#### Sharing Skills
**Purpose**: Share and distribute skills across projects
**Process**:
- Document skills clearly
- Make skills reusable
- Share with other projects
- Maintain skill repositories
