# AI Orchestration Guide - Multi-Model Development Environment

## Overview

This guide documents your comprehensive AI development environment that orchestrates multiple AI models, CLI tools, IDEs, and MCP servers to create a powerful collaborative development system.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **AI Models** (in order of importance):
   - Claude 4.5 (Primary)
   - GPT-5-Codex (low/medium/high)
   - Cheetah (Claude in Cursor)
   - Code-Supernova-1-Million (Claude in Cline)
   - GPT-5 (low/medium/high)
   - Gemini 2.5 Pro/Flash
   - Grok 4 Code Fast

2. **CLI Tools**:
   - Claude Code CLI (`claude`)
   - OpenAI Codex CLI (`codex`)
   - Gemini CLI (`gemini`)
   - GitHub Copilot CLI (`copilot`)

   - Cursor CLI (`cursor-agent` - WSL only)
   - Qwen CLI (`qwen`)

3. **IDEs**:
   - Cursor IDE (Primary)
   - JetBrains WebStorm
   - VS Code (via Cline)

4. **MCP Servers** (Essential):
   - **Serena MCP**: Memory-based orchestration and large project file access

   - **Filesystem**: File operations within project directory
   - **Memory**: Persistent memory across sessions
   - **Sequential Thinking**: Enhanced reasoning capabilities
   - **Postgres**: Database operations (if using PostgreSQL)
   - **JetBrains**: IDE integration (when WebStorm is open)

## Configuration Files

All tools are configured with standardized MCP server settings:

- `C:\Users\hyper\.codex\config.toml` - Codex CLI configuration
- `C:\Users\hyper\.cursor\mcp.json` - Cursor IDE MCP settings
- `C:\Users\hyper\.claude.json` - Claude CLI configuration
- `C:\Users\hyper\.gemini\settings.json` - Gemini CLI settings
- `C:\Users\hyper\.copilot\mcp-config.json` - Copilot CLI settings
- `C:\Users\hyper\.grok\settings.json` - Grok CLI settings
- `C:\Users\hyper\AppData\Roaming\Cursor\User\globalStorage\saoudrizwan.claude-dev\settings\cline_mcp_settings.json` - Cline settings

## Key Features

### 1. Multi-Model Orchestration

**Zen MCP Server** provides the core orchestration capabilities:
- `chat`: Multi-model brainstorming and discussion
- `thinkdeep`: Extended reasoning and analysis
- `planner`: Structured planning and task breakdown
- `consensus`: Multi-model consensus analysis
- `debug`: Systematic debugging assistance
- `codereview`: Professional code reviews
- `refactor`: Intelligent code refactoring
- `testgen`: Comprehensive test generation
- `secaudit`: Security audits
- `docgen`: Documentation generation

### 2. Memory-Based Context

**Serena MCP** maintains context across sessions:
- Large project file access
- Memory-based orchestration
- Persistent context across AI model interactions
- Project-specific knowledge retention

### 3. Cross-Tool Communication

Each CLI tool can communicate with others through MCP bridges:
- Codex CLI Bridge
- Claude CLI Bridge
- Gemini CLI Bridge
- Grok CLI Bridge

### 4. Process Management

Use `process-manager.ps1` to manage AI-related processes:
```powershell
.\process-manager.ps1 -List      # List all AI processes
.\process-manager.ps1 -Cleanup   # Clean up old processes
.\process-manager.ps1 -Monitor   # Real-time monitoring
.\process-manager.ps1 -KillAll   # Kill all AI processes
```

## Usage Patterns

### 1. Parallel Model Collaboration

1. Start multiple CLI tools simultaneously
2. Use Zen MCP Server's `consensus` tool for multi-model decision making
3. Leverage Serena MCP for shared context and memory
4. Use CLI bridges for cross-tool communication

### 2. Task Delegation

1. Use Zen MCP Server's `planner` to break down complex tasks
2. Delegate specific subtasks to specialized models
3. Use `chat` for brainstorming and idea generation
4. Use `thinkdeep` for complex reasoning tasks

### 3. Code Development Workflow

1. Use `codereview` for code quality assurance
2. Use `refactor` for code improvement
3. Use `testgen` for comprehensive testing
4. Use `secaudit` for security validation
5. Use `docgen` for documentation

## Environment Variables

Essential environment variables for all tools:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: OpenAI/Codex access
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: Claude access
- `GEMINI_API_KEY`: Gemini access
- `XAI_API_KEY`: Grok access
- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`: OpenRouter access
- `POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING`: Database access

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **MCP Timeout Errors**: 
   - Increased timeout values to 300 seconds for heavy servers
   - Expanded environment variable whitelist
   - Use process manager to clean up stuck processes

2. **Process Leaks**:
   - Run `.\process-manager.ps1 -Cleanup` regularly
   - Monitor with `.\process-manager.ps1 -Monitor`
   - Kill all processes with `.\process-manager.ps1 -KillAll`

3. **JetBrains Integration**:
   - Only works when WebStorm is open
   - Requires specific Java classpath configuration
   - Uses port 64342 for communication

### Performance Optimization

1. **Startup Optimization**:
   - Use increased timeout values (300s for heavy servers)
   - Enable only essential MCP servers
   - Use process manager to prevent resource leaks

2. **Memory Management**:
   - Serena MCP handles large project contexts
   - Memory MCP provides persistent storage
   - Regular cleanup prevents memory leaks

## Best Practices

1. **Start with Core Tools**: Begin with Claude, Codex, and Zen MCP Server
2. **Use Serena for Context**: Leverage Serena MCP for large project understanding
3. **Monitor Processes**: Regularly check and clean up AI processes
4. **Standardize Configurations**: Keep all tool configurations synchronized
5. **Leverage Multi-Model Consensus**: Use Zen MCP Server for complex decisions
