# AI Orchestration Guide - Multi-Model Development Environment

## Overview

This guide documents your comprehensive AI development environment that orchestrates multiple AI models, CLI tools, IDEs, and MCP servers to create a powerful collaborative development system.

## Architecture

### Core Components

- Grok CLI Bridge

### 4. Process Management

Use `process-manager.ps1` to manage AI-related processes:
```powershell
.\process-manager.ps1 -List      # List all AI processes
.\process-manager.ps1 -Cleanup   # Clean up old processes
.\process-manager.ps1 -Monitor   # Real-time monitoring
.\process-manager.ps1 -KillAll   # Kill all AI processes
```

## Usage Patterns

### 1. Parallel Model Collaboration

1. Start multiple CLI tools simultaneously
2. Use Zen MCP Server's `consensus` tool for multi-model decision making
3. Leverage Serena MCP for shared context and memory
4. Use CLI bridges for cross-tool communication

### 2. Task Delegation

1. Use Zen MCP Server's `planner` to break down complex tasks
2. Delegate specific subtasks to specialized models
3. Use `chat` for brainstorming and idea generation
4. Use `thinkdeep` for complex reasoning tasks

### 3. Code Development Workflow

1. Use `codereview` for code quality assurance
2. Use `refactor` for code improvement
3. Use `testgen` for comprehensive testing
4. Use `secaudit` for security validation
5. Use `docgen` for documentation

## Environment Variables

Essential environment variables for all tools:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: OpenAI/Codex access
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: Claude access
- `GEMINI_API_KEY`: Gemini access
- `XAI_API_KEY`: Grok access
- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`: OpenRouter access
- `POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING`: Database access

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **MCP Timeout Errors**: 
   - Increased timeout values to 300 seconds for heavy servers
   - Expanded environment variable whitelist
   - Use process manager to clean up stuck processes

2. **Process Leaks**:
   - Run `.\process-manager.ps1 -Cleanup` regularly
   - Monitor with `.\process-manager.ps1 -Monitor`
   - Kill all processes with `.\process-manager.ps1 -KillAll`

3. **JetBrains Integration**:
   - Only works when WebStorm is open
   - Requires specific Java classpath configuration
   - Uses port 64342 for communication

### Performance Optimization

1. **Startup Optimization**:
   - Use increased timeout values (300s for heavy servers)
   - Enable only essential MCP servers
   - Use process manager to prevent resource leaks

2. **Memory Management**:
   - Serena MCP handles large project contexts
   - Memory MCP provides persistent storage
   - Regular cleanup prevents memory leaks

## Best Practices

2. **Use Serena for Context**: Leverage Serena MCP for large project understanding
3. **Monitor Processes**: Regularly check and clean up AI processes
4. **Standardize Configurations**: Keep all tool configurations synchronized
5. **Leverage Multi-Model Consensus**: Use Zen MCP Server for complex decisions

## 🎯 AI Skills and Development Methodologies

### Collaboration Skills

#### Brainstorming Ideas Into Designs
**Purpose**: Transform rough ideas into fully-formed designs through structured questioning
**Key Phases**:
1. **Understanding** - Ask questions to gather purpose, constraints, success criteria
2. **Exploration** - Propose 2-3 different approaches with trade-offs
3. **Design Presentation** - Present in 200-300 word sections for validation
4. **Design Documentation** - Write design document to `docs/plans/`
5. **Worktree Setup** - Set up isolated workspace for implementation
6. **Planning Handoff** - Create detailed implementation plan

**Core Principles**:
- One question at a time during understanding phase
- Use AskUserQuestion tool for structured choices
- Present design incrementally for validation
- Go backward when needed - flexibility over rigid progression
- Apply YAGNI ruthlessly

#### Dispatching Parallel Agents
**Purpose**: Handle multiple independent failures concurrently
**When to Use**:
- 3+ independent failures that can be investigated without shared state
- Each problem can be understood without context from others
- No shared state between investigations

**Process**:
1. **Identify Independent Domains** - Group failures by what's broken
2. **Create Focused Agent Tasks** - Each agent gets specific scope and clear goal
3. **Dispatch in Parallel** - Multiple agents work concurrently
4. **Review and Integrate** - Review summaries, verify no conflicts, integrate changes

#### Subagent-Driven Development
**Purpose**: Execute implementation plans with fresh subagent per task
**Process**:
1. **Load Plan** - Read plan file, create TodoWrite with all tasks
2. **Execute Task with Subagent** - Dispatch fresh subagent for each task
3. **Review Subagent's Work** - Dispatch code-reviewer subagent
4. **Apply Review Feedback** - Fix issues before next task
5. **Mark Complete, Next Task** - Repeat for all tasks
6. **Final Review** - Review entire implementation
7. **Complete Development** - Use finishing-a-development-branch skill

### Debugging Skills

#### Systematic Debugging
**Purpose**: Four-phase framework for understanding bugs before attempting fixes
**The Iron Law**: NO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION FIRST

**Four Phases**:
1. **Root Cause Investigation** - Read errors, reproduce, check changes, gather evidence
2. **Pattern Analysis** - Find working examples, compare against references
3. **Hypothesis and Testing** - Form single hypothesis, test minimally
4. **Implementation** - Create failing test, implement fix, verify

**Red Flags** (STOP and follow process):
- "Quick fix for now, investigate later"
- "Just try changing X and see if it works"
- "Add multiple changes, run tests"
- Proposing solutions before tracing data flow
- "One more fix attempt" (when already tried 2+)

#### Root Cause Tracing
**Purpose**: Backward tracing technique for errors deep in call stack
**Process**:
- Where does bad value originate?
- What called this with bad value?
- Keep tracing up until you find the source
- Fix at source, not at symptom

### Development Skills

#### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
**Purpose**: Write test first, watch it fail, write minimal code to pass
**The Iron Law**: NO PRODUCTION CODE WITHOUT A FAILING TEST FIRST

**Red-Green-Refactor Cycle**:
1. **RED** - Write failing test, verify it fails correctly
2. **GREEN** - Write minimal code to pass, verify it passes
3. **REFACTOR** - Clean up while keeping tests green

**Key Principles**:
- If you didn't watch the test fail, you don't know if it tests the right thing
- Write code before the test? Delete it. Start over.
- One behavior per test
- Clear test names
- Real code (no mocks unless unavoidable)

#### Writing Plans
**Purpose**: Create comprehensive implementation plans for engineers with zero codebase context
**Structure**:
- Bite-sized task granularity (2-5 minutes per step)
- Exact file paths always
- Complete code in plan (not "add validation")
- Exact commands with expected output
- DRY, YAGNI, TDD, frequent commits

#### Executing Plans
**Purpose**: Implement plans task-by-task with verification
**Process**:
1. **Load Plan** - Read plan file, understand structure
2. **Execute Task** - Implement each task following TDD
3. **Verify Task** - Run tests, check output
4. **Commit Task** - Commit with descriptive message
5. **Next Task** - Repeat until all tasks complete

### Quality Assurance Skills

#### Code Review
**Purpose**: Professional code reviews with structured feedback
**Template Structure**:
- **WHAT_WAS_IMPLEMENTED**: Summary of changes
- **PLAN_OR_REQUIREMENTS**: Original requirements
- **BASE_SHA/HEAD_SHA**: Git commit references
- **DESCRIPTION**: Task summary

**Review Categories**:
- **Strengths**: What was done well
- **Issues**: Critical/Important/Minor issues
- **Assessment**: Overall quality and readiness

#### Verification Before Completion
**Purpose**: Verify fix worked before claiming success
**Process**:
- Run full test suite
- Check for regressions
- Verify all requirements met
- Document what was fixed

### Writing and Communication Skills

#### Writing Clearly and Concisely
**Purpose**: Apply Strunk's timeless writing rules to any prose
**Key Rules**:
- Use active voice
- Put statements in positive form
- Use definite, specific, concrete language
- Omit needless words
- Keep related words together
- Place emphatic words at end of sentence

### Meta Skills

#### Using Git Worktrees
**Purpose**: Set up isolated workspaces for safe experimentation
**Process**:
1. **Directory Selection** - Choose appropriate directory
2. **Safety Verification** - Ensure no conflicts with main work
3. **Setup** - Create worktree with proper configuration
4. **Verification** - Confirm worktree is ready for use

#### Sharing Skills
**Purpose**: Share and distribute skills across projects
**Process**:
- Document skills clearly
- Make skills reusable
- Share with other projects
- Maintain skill repositories
