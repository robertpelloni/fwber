## 🗺️ High-Level Trajectory

### The OkCupid Matching Engine (COMPLETED - v2.1.5)
The matching engine has been upgraded to a value-based system with importance weighting and a geometric-mean compatibility heuristic.

**Key Achievements:**
- **Geometric-Mean Heuristic**: Implemented the classic formula `(Satisfaction A * Satisfaction B) ^ (1/2)` for high-fidelity signals.
- **Value-Based Questions**: Integrated multiple-choice questions with user-defined importance levels.
- **Interactive UI**: Launched a dedicated matching dashboard at `/settings/matching`.
- **Deep Integration**: Compatibility scores are now visible across user profiles and the discovery feed.

### The High-Performance Autonomous Engine (COMPLETED - v2.1.4)
The autonomous system is now fully instrumented for performance and quality, with a self-healing engine that monitors latency and system health in real-time.

**Key Achievements:**
- **SLA Visibility**: Real-time breakdown of task execution times and success trends.
- **Content Enrichment**: Integrated 50+ high-quality matching questions to drive user engagement.
- **System-Wide Oversight**: Critical paths in Matching, Tokenomics, Federation, and Geo-Discovery are now under autonomous supervision.

### The Self-Healing Autonomous Engine (COMPLETED - v2.1.3)
The autonomous system now features a self-healing engine capable of executing tasks with oversight and automatically recovering from degraded states.

### The Autonomous System Hardening (COMPLETED - v2.0.23)
The autonomous system now features real-time action logging and an enhanced management interface.

**Hardening Highlights:**
- **ActivityPub Integration**: Federation broadcast tasks are now monitored in real-time by the autonomous execution engine.
- **UX Refinement**: Descriptive tooltips in the Admin UI improve operator understanding of automated adjustment impacts.
- **Infrastructure**: `AutonomousService` provides a standardized utility for logging system tasks and checking adjustment state.

### The Autonomous System Integration (COMPLETED - v2.0.18/v2.0.19)
Integrated the autonomous execution protocol into the main system with real-time monitoring and logic-level verification.
