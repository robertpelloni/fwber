commu# FWBer.me Modernization Project

This document outlines the current state of the FWBer.me application following a comprehensive security and architectural overhaul. It is intended as a handoff document for future development.

## 1. Project Overview

The original FWBer.me application was a legacy PHP project from 2011. The primary goal of this modernization effort was to address critical security vulnerabilities and refactor the core application to use modern, professional-grade development practices. This initial overhaul is now complete.

The application is now built on a secure, object-oriented foundation, making it stable, maintainable, and ready for future feature development and eventual migration to a full Laravel/Next.js stack.

## 2. Current State of the Application

The application is in a stable, functional, and secure state. The core user-facing features have been completely rewritten.

- **Technology Stack:** PHP 8+, PDO for database access, Composer for dependency management.
- **Key Libraries:** `phpmailer/phpmailer`, `vlucas/phpdotenv`.
- **Modernized Pages:** `index.php`, `signin.php`, `signout.php`, `forgot-password.php`, `settings.php`, `profile.php`, `edit-profile.php`, `matches.php`, `manage-pics.php`, `contact.php`.

## 3. Key Architectural Components

The new architecture is designed to be modular and secure, with a clear separation of concerns.

### `_init.php`
This is the new central bootstrap file for the application. It is responsible for:
1.  Loading the Composer autoloader.
2.  Loading environment variables (API keys, etc.) from the `.env` file.
3.  Establishing the secure PDO database connection (`_db.php`).
4.  Initializing the core manager classes (`SecurityManager`, `ProfileManager`, etc.).

### `_db.php`
This file contains the single source of truth for the application's database connection, using PDO for secure, modern database interactions.

### Manager Classes
- **`SecurityManager.php`**: The heart of the application's security. It handles:
    - **Password Hashing:** Using the modern `Argon2ID` algorithm.
    - **Session Management:** Secure, database-driven session validation.
    - **CSRF Protection:** Generation and validation of single-use CSRF tokens for all forms.
    - **Rate Limiting:** Protection against brute-force attacks on authentication endpoints.
- **`ProfileManager.php`**: A robust class for managing all user profile data. It intelligently handles data for both the `users` and `user_preferences` tables, making the profile system easily extensible.
- **`PhotoManager.php`**: A secure class for handling all aspects of photo management, including secure file uploads (with MIME type validation), secure file deletion, and database integration.

### API Endpoints (`/api/`)
The application now uses a modern API-driven approach for dynamic frontend features. All API endpoints are secure and use the manager classes to perform their actions.

## 4. Security Hardening Summary

A comprehensive security overhaul was completed, addressing all critical vulnerabilities identified during the code review process.

- **✅ CSRF Protection:** All forms are now protected by single-use CSRF tokens, validated by the `SecurityManager`.
- **✅ Rate Limiting:** The `signin.php` and `forgot-password.php` pages are now protected from brute-force and spam attacks using IP-based rate limiting.
- **✅ Secure HTTPS:** The application now uses a robust `isSecure()` function to reliably detect and enforce secure HTTPS connections.
- **✅ Modern Authentication:** The old MD5-based password system has been completely replaced with `Argon2ID` hashing and secure, database-backed sessions.
- **✅ SQL Injection Prevention:** All database queries have been migrated to PDO with prepared statements.

## 5. Development Environment Setup

To get the application running locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository:** Clone the project to your local machine (e.g., into `C:/xampp/htdocs`).
2.  **Install Dependencies:** Open a terminal in the project root and run `composer install`.
3.  **Create `.env` File:** Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your secret API keys. Use the following template:
    ```
    REPLICATE_API_TOKEN="YOUR_REPLICATE_API_TOKEN_HERE"
    OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```
4.  **Set Up the Database:**
    - In phpMyAdmin, create a new user: `fwber` with password `Temppass0!` (or your preferred password, updated in `_secrets.php`).
    - When creating the user, check the box to **"Create database with same name and grant all privileges."**
    - Navigate to the newly created `fwber` database and use the "Import" tab to run the `setup-database.sql` script.

## 6. The Path to Launch (Next Steps)

The application is now ready for the final pre-launch phase. The following tasks remain:

1.  **Complete the Profile Form:** This is the #1 priority. The `profile-form.php` file needs to be updated to include all the detailed preference fields from the original design. The backend `ProfileManager` is already built to handle this data automatically.

2.  **Thorough End-to-End Testing:** Once the profile form is complete, the entire application must be tested systematically to find and fix any remaining bugs.

3.  **Final Polish:** Modernize any remaining minor pages and implement the placeholder AI/ML logic in the `AIMatchingEngine` when ready.

## 7. A Note on Project History

This project was modernized in a unique collaboration between a human developer and multiple AI assistants (Gemini and Claude). The development process was iterative and conversational, which is reflected in the evolution of the codebase. This `README.md` serves as the canonical summary of the project's current state, superseding any previous conversational logs.

## Migration & Diagnostics (Legacy Matcher Compatibility)

To ensure the legacy matcher works with the new profile form:

1) Enable debug and start the app
- Copy and edit your environment
```cmd
copy .env.example .env
notepad .env
```
- Set `DEBUG_MODE=true`, then start a local server (or use your Apache/XAMPP)
```cmd
php -S 127.0.0.1:8000
```

2) Apply the migration (login required)
- Visit: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/scripts/apply_migration_web.php`
- Expected: `Applied N migration statements successfully.`
- If you see `Forbidden`, ensure you are logged in and `DEBUG_MODE=true`.

3) Verify mirrors and columns
- Visit: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/scripts/profile_diagnostics.php`
- Confirm: no missing columns and b_* mirrors appear in users after saving your profile.

4) Run a quick smoke test
- Create two users, set complementary preferences, and confirm matches appear.

5) Disable debug for safety
```cmd
notepad .env
```
Set `DEBUG_MODE=false`


## CLI Migration (optional)
If PHP and MySQL CLIs are available, you can run:
```cmd
php scripts\apply_migration.php
```
Or:
```cmd
mysql -h localhost -u fwber -p fwber < db\migrations\2025-10-11-legacy-matcher-compat.sql
```
