# FWBer.com

This is the PHP source code to FWBer.com, an open source Adult Match website.  Its goal is to replace the defunct Craigslist Casual Encounters and websites like AdultFriendFinder with a completely free and open source replacement that improves upon the concept.


## Supports all types of lifestyles and preferences.

Men, women, couples, groups, transgender, crossdressers, straight, gay, and bisexual lifestyles are supported.  More preferences to come in the future.

## Match by dozens of specific sexual interests and fetishes.

Find exactly who you are looking for, no matter how kinky.  More fetishes and kinks can be easily added by the community.

## Automatic avatar creation based on your attributes.

You don't need a public picture.  We make one for you.  Create your FWBer avatar by filling out your profile.  This levels the playing field for everyone, gives an idea of what to expect, and discourages bots with fake pictures.

## No searching. Automatic matches based on sexual interests.

No digging through hundreds of profiles. We find you and send you to each other.  You are alerted instantly when someone new signs up who matches your interests.

## Privacy comes first. We only show your profile to your matches.

Your pictures always remain private until you agree to show them.  Private pictures are only shown to matches you authorize.  Public pictures are shown to potential matches only.  Share as much or as little information as you want.

## Messaging is done off-site using your preferred tools.

We don't have a built in messenger, we only share your contact information with your authorized matches.  You communicate through email, text, phone, Skype, Kik, whatever you decide.  That keeps your data safe, protects us from liability, and uses higher quality tools than an in-built messenger.  We hook you up, the rest is up to you.

## Open source and fully transparent.

Verify your data is stored properly and your secrets are safe.  Suggest new features or add them yourself.  FWBer.com is licensed under the AGPL v3.
