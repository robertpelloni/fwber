**Privacy-first, proximity-based social platform.** fwber replaces swipe-based dating with real-world connection — AI avatars instead of profile photos, fuzzy location instead of GPS tracking, and value-based matching instead of superficial algorithms.

## What Is fwber?

fwber is a dating and social platform built around a simple idea: **technology should get you off your phone and into the real world.** Instead of infinite scrolling through headshots, fwber uses AI-generated avatars, proximity-based discovery, and deep compatibility matching to facilitate genuine, intentional connections.

**The core loop:**

1. **Onboard** — Set your values, answer personality questions, define what matters to you
2. **Discover** — Browse nearby people via the Local Pulse feed, filtered by compatibility scores
3. **Connect** — Match based on shared values and proximity, not just looks
4. **Reveal** — Photos stay behind AI avatars until you choose to share them
5. **Meet** — Plan dates, find nearby events, connect in person

### What Makes It Different

- **AI Avatars by Default** — Your real photos are hidden behind AI-generated avatars until you explicitly reveal them. No more snap judgments based on a profile picture.
- **Fuzzy Location** — Your exact GPS coordinates are never shared. Location is fuzzed to a general area for proximity matching only.
- **Value-Based Matching** — An OkCupid-style compatibility engine with 95 personality questions across 7 categories (lifestyle, romance, personality, ethics, interests, intimacy, communication). Scores use a geometric-mean heuristic weighted by how important each question is to you.
- **Local Pulse** — A proximity-based discovery feed showing nearby people, events, and venues — the digital aura of your neighborhood, not a global feed of strangers.
- **End-to-End Encryption** — Messages are encrypted. Your conversations stay private.
- **Ghost Mode** — Browse invisibly. Your profile views and presence are only shared when you want them to be.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 20+ (LTS recommended)
- **MySQL** or **PostgreSQL**
- **Redis** (for caching, sessions, and queues)
- **Rust** toolchain (optional, for building the geo service)

### Quick Start (Development)

Use the included launcher script:

```bat
start.bat
```

This starts both services:
- **Backend**: http://localhost:4000
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000

### Manual Setup

#### Backend

```bash
cd fwber-backend-ts
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your database credentials
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push
npm run dev
```

#### Frontend

```bash
cd fwber-frontend
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your API URL
npm run dev
```

#### Geo Service (Optional)

```bash
cd fwber-geo
cargo run --release
# Serves on http://localhost:8081
```

### Environment Variables

**Backend** (`fwber-backend-ts/.env`):

```env
DATABASE_URL=mysql://user:password@localhost:3306/fwber
REDIS_HOST=127.0.0.1
JWT_SECRET=your-secret
GEO_SCREENER_URL=http://localhost:8081
# Optional AI providers:
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-...
# Optional payments:
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
# Optional email:
RESEND_API_KEY=re_...
```

**Frontend** (`fwber-frontend/.env.local`):

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:4000
NEXT_PUBLIC_REVERB_HOST=localhost
NEXT_PUBLIC_REVERB_SCHEME=http
```

## Deployment

fwber deploys to a **Hetzner VPS + Vercel** topology:

- **Frontend** (`fwber.me`) → Vercel
- **Backend API** (`api.fwber.me`) → Hetzner VPS
- **WebSocket** (`ws.fwber.me`) → Hetzner VPS
- **Geo Service** (`geo.fwber.me`) → Hetzner VPS

Deployment scripts, nginx configs, and systemd service files are in `ops/hetzner/`.

GitHub Actions workflows handle automated deploys on push to `main`.

See [DEPLOY.md](DEPLOY.md) for the full deployment guide.

## Project History

fwber originated in 2011 as a PHP/MySQL dating application and evolved through Laravel into a feature-rich platform. In 2026, the entire backend was migrated from PHP/Laravel to a unified TypeScript/Node.js stack (the "Great Migration," v2.0.0-ts). The legacy PHP codebase is archived in `ARCHIVE_v1_8_php_legacy/`.

The license changed from AGPL-v3 (legacy PHP) to MIT (modern TypeScript rewrite).
