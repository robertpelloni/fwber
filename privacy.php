Third-party websites<br>
<br>
There are a number of places on our website where you may click on a link to access other websites that do not operate under this Privacy Policy.<br>
For example, if you click on an advertisement on our website, you may be taken to a website that we do not control.<br>
These third-party websites may independently solicit and collect information, including personal information, from you and, in some instances, provide us with information about your activities on those websites.<br>
We recommend that you consult the privacy statements of all third-party websites you visit by clicking on the "privacy" link typically located at the bottom of the webpage you are visiting.<br>
<br>
How you can access your information<br>
<br>
If you have an online account with us, you have the ability to review and update your personal information online by logging into your account and clicking on your account settings.<br>
More information about how to contact us is provided below.<br>
If you have an online account with us, you also may close your account at any time by visiting the "Account Settings" page for your account.<br>
After you close your account, you will not be able to sign in to our website or access any of your personal information.<br>
However, you can open a new, separate account at any time.<br>
If you close your account, we may still retain certain information associated with your account for analytical purposes and recordkeeping integrity, as well as to prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, enforce our terms and conditions, take actions we deem necessary to protect the integrity of our website or our users, or take other actions otherwise permitted by law.<br>

Your choices about collection and use of your information<br>
<br>
   You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but that may result in you being unable to use certain features of our website because such information may be required in order for you to register as a member or use provided services.<br>
   At any time you can choose to no longer receive commercial or promotional emails from us by visiting the "Account Settings" page associated with your account.<br>
When you register on our website, you will consent, or be given a choice as to whether you want, to receive email messages from us.<br>

Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches, or other communications will always remain secure.<br>
Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information and should avoid sending personal information through insecure email.<br>

<br>
We provide areas on our websites where you can post information about yourself and others and communicate with others or upload content such as photographs.<br>
Such postings are governed by our Terms of Service.<br>
In addition, such postings may appear on other websites or when searches are executed on the subject of your posting.<br>
Also, whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on publicly-viewable web pages, that information will be publicly available and can be collected and used by others.<br>
For example, if you post your email address, you may receive unsolicited messages.<br>
We cannot control who reads your posting or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your personal information.<br>
