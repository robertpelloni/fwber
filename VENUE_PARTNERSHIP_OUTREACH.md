## 1. COLD EMAIL TEMPLATE

**Subject:** Increase Foot Traffic at [Venue Name] with Location-Based Dating Tech

Hi [Venue Owner/Manager Name],

I'm reaching out because [Venue Name] is exactly the kind of sex-positive space our users are looking for. FWBer.me is a dating platform that lets users announce their presence at venues in real-time, creating spontaneous connections and driving repeat visits. We're launching a free 4-week pilot program with select venues, and I'd love to explore a partnership with [Venue Name].

Our early data shows venues with check-in features see 30-40% more repeat visitors. No upfront costs, just a quick 15-minute call to see if it's a fit.

Available for a brief call this week?

Best,
[Your Name]
