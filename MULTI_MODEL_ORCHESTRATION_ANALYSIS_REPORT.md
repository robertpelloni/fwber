## How Parallel Orchestration Works

### 1. **Task Analysis & Assignment**
```javascript
// The orchestrator analyzes incoming tasks and assigns them to appropriate models
analyzeTaskAndAssign(taskDescription) {
  // Architecture tasks ‚Üí Claude 4.5
  // Coding tasks ‚Üí GPT-5-Codex
  // Performance tasks ‚Üí Cheetah
  // Context tasks ‚Üí Code-Supernova-1-million
  // Alternative perspectives ‚Üí Gemini 2.5 Flash
}
```

### 2. **Parallel Execution**
```javascript
// Multiple models work simultaneously
const promises = modelAssignments.map(async (assignment) => {
  return await this.consultModel(assignment.model, assignment.task, taskId);
});

const results = await Promise.allSettled(promises);
```

### 3. **Consensus Building**
```javascript
// Weighted confidence system
const weightedConfidence = successful.reduce((sum, result) => {
  const tier = result.capabilities.tier;
  const weight = 6 - tier; // Higher tier = higher weight
  return sum + (result.confidence * weight);
}, 0) / totalWeight;
```

### 4. **Context Sharing**
- **Coordination Directory:** `C:\Users\mrgen\fwber\AI_COORDINATION\`
- **Session Files:** Individual model responses stored as JSON
- **Task State:** Persistent task tracking and results
- **Consensus Records:** Final recommendations and confidence scores
