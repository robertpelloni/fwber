## üó£Ô∏è Multi-AI Debate and Decision Points

### Debate 1: Feature Development vs. Production Readiness
**Claude Position**: Complete all core features before deployment
**Gemini Consensus Position**: Prioritize production deployment and user validation
**Decision**: Adopt Gemini's lean approach - deploy MVP first, validate with users

### Debate 2: Technical Architecture Choices
**Database**: MySQL with spatial functions vs. PostgreSQL with PostGIS
**Decision**: MySQL with spatial functions (already implemented)
**Reasoning**: Existing Laravel stack compatibility, sufficient for current scale

**WebSockets**: Self-hosted vs. Managed service
**Decision**: Start with self-hosted, plan migration to managed service
**Reasoning**: Cost control initially, scalability for growth

### Debate 3: Security vs. Speed to Market
**Claude Position**: Implement comprehensive security from start
**Gemini Position**: Security audit before launch, but don't delay MVP
**Decision**: Conduct security audit in parallel with MVP preparation

### Debate 4: Monetization Strategy
**Freemium Model**: Basic free, premium features paid
**Partnership Model**: Revenue sharing with venues
**API Model**: Developer ecosystem
**Decision**: Implement freemium model first, add partnerships later
