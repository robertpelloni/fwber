- **Autonomous Decision Engine**: Implemented `AutonomousDecisionEngine` to evaluate proposed actions against system health and protocol settings.
- **Heuristic Safety**: The engine automatically denies medium/high impact actions if protocol consistency is low, or delegates them if strict mode is enabled.

## [2.0.29] - 2026-05-24

- **Repository Synchronization**: Executed an intensive repository refresh, synchronized submodules, and reconciled all active feature branches into `main`.
- **Submodule Sanitization**: Updated all recursive submodules to latest tracking commits and verified workspace hygiene.

- **Instrumentation Expansion**: Full visibility for `AuthService` (Login/Register) and `ContactSyncService` tasks in the autonomous ledger.
- **Merchant Loyalty UI**: Launched a unified program configuration and signal monitoring dashboard at `/merchant/loyalty`.

- **Testing Isolation**: Refactored Merchant Loyalty API tests to use isolated database contexts, eliminating interference during parallel execution.
