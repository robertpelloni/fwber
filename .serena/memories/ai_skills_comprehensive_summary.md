## üìö Skill Categories and Summaries

### 1. Collaboration Skills

#### Brainstorming Ideas Into Designs
**Purpose**: Transform rough ideas into fully-formed designs through structured questioning
**Key Phases**:
1. **Understanding** - Ask questions to gather purpose, constraints, success criteria
2. **Exploration** - Propose 2-3 different approaches with trade-offs
3. **Design Presentation** - Present in 200-300 word sections for validation
4. **Design Documentation** - Write design document to `docs/plans/`
5. **Worktree Setup** - Set up isolated workspace for implementation
6. **Planning Handoff** - Create detailed implementation plan

**Core Principles**:
- One question at a time during understanding phase
- Use AskUserQuestion tool for structured choices
- Present design incrementally for validation
- Go backward when needed - flexibility over rigid progression
- Apply YAGNI ruthlessly

#### Dispatching Parallel Agents
**Purpose**: Handle multiple independent failures concurrently
**When to Use**:
- 3+ independent failures that can be investigated without shared state
- Each problem can be understood without context from others
- No shared state between investigations

**Process**:
1. **Identify Independent Domains** - Group failures by what's broken
2. **Create Focused Agent Tasks** - Each agent gets specific scope and clear goal
3. **Dispatch in Parallel** - Multiple agents work concurrently
4. **Review and Integrate** - Review summaries, verify no conflicts, integrate changes

**Benefits**:
- Parallelization - Multiple investigations happen simultaneously
- Focus - Each agent has narrow scope, less context to track
- Independence - Agents don't interfere with each other
- Speed - 3 problems solved in time of 1

#### Subagent-Driven Development
**Purpose**: Execute implementation plans with fresh subagent per task
**Process**:
1. **Load Plan** - Read plan file, create TodoWrite with all tasks
2. **Execute Task with Subagent** - Dispatch fresh subagent for each task
3. **Review Subagent's Work** - Dispatch code-reviewer subagent
4. **Apply Review Feedback** - Fix issues before next task
5. **Mark Complete, Next Task** - Repeat for all tasks
6. **Final Review** - Review entire implementation
7. **Complete Development** - Use finishing-a-development-branch skill

**Advantages**:
- Fresh context per task (no confusion)
- Parallel-safe (subagents don't interfere)
- Continuous progress with quality gates
- Catches issues early

### 2. Debugging Skills

#### Systematic Debugging
**Purpose**: Four-phase framework for understanding bugs before attempting fixes
**The Iron Law**: NO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION FIRST

**Four Phases**:
1. **Root Cause Investigation** - Read errors, reproduce, check changes, gather evidence
2. **Pattern Analysis** - Find working examples, compare against references
3. **Hypothesis and Testing** - Form single hypothesis, test minimally
4. **Implementation** - Create failing test, implement fix, verify

**Red Flags** (STOP and follow process):
- "Quick fix for now, investigate later"
- "Just try changing X and see if it works"
- "Add multiple changes, run tests"
- Proposing solutions before tracing data flow
- "One more fix attempt" (when already tried 2+)

#### Root Cause Tracing
**Purpose**: Backward tracing technique for errors deep in call stack
**Process**:
- Where does bad value originate?
- What called this with bad value?
- Keep tracing up until you find the source
- Fix at source, not at symptom

#### Defense in Depth
**Purpose**: Add validation at multiple layers after finding root cause
**Application**: Implement validation at each system boundary

### 3. Development Skills

#### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
**Purpose**: Write test first, watch it fail, write minimal code to pass
**The Iron Law**: NO PRODUCTION CODE WITHOUT A FAILING TEST FIRST

**Red-Green-Refactor Cycle**:
1. **RED** - Write failing test, verify it fails correctly
2. **GREEN** - Write minimal code to pass, verify it passes
3. **REFACTOR** - Clean up while keeping tests green

**Key Principles**:
- If you didn't watch the test fail, you don't know if it tests the right thing
- Write code before the test? Delete it. Start over.
- One behavior per test
- Clear test names
- Real code (no mocks unless unavoidable)

#### Writing Plans
**Purpose**: Create comprehensive implementation plans for engineers with zero codebase context
**Structure**:
- Bite-sized task granularity (2-5 minutes per step)
- Exact file paths always
- Complete code in plan (not "add validation")
- Exact commands with expected output
- DRY, YAGNI, TDD, frequent commits

#### Executing Plans
**Purpose**: Implement plans task-by-task with verification
**Process**:
1. **Load Plan** - Read plan file, understand structure
2. **Execute Task** - Implement each task following TDD
3. **Verify Task** - Run tests, check output
4. **Commit Task** - Commit with descriptive message
5. **Next Task** - Repeat until all tasks complete

### 4. Quality Assurance Skills
