# Database Setup Challenge - January 19, 2025

## Issue:
MySQL user 'fwber'@'localhost' cannot be created or authenticated properly.

## Attempted Solutions:
1. ✅ MySQL service is running
2. ✅ Database 'fwber' exists
3. ❌ User creation failing - Access denied error 1045
4. ❌ Laravel migrations cannot run without database access

## Current Status:
- Laravel backend is fully implemented and ready
- Next.js frontend is ready with API client
- Security hardening is complete
- Database setup is the only blocker

## Alternative Approaches:
1. **Use existing database** - Check if there's already a working database setup
2. **Use SQLite for testing** - Laravel supports SQLite for development
3. **Focus on other development** - Continue with frontend development and documentation
4. **Manual database setup** - Use phpMyAdmin or MySQL Workbench

## Next Steps:
1. Try SQLite for immediate testing
2. Document current progress
3. Provide manual database setup instructions
4. Continue with other development tasks
