### Session 5: Launch Strategy
**Participants**: Claude Sonnet 4.5, Gemini 2.5 Pro (Consensus)
**Topic**: Broad launch vs. targeted community launch

**Claude Position**:
- Broad launch for maximum reach
- Marketing-driven user acquisition
- Scale quickly
- Risk: High marketing costs, user quality issues

**Gemini Position**:
- Targeted community launch
- Dense user base for network effects
- Organic growth
- Risk: Limited reach, slower growth

**Decision**: Targeted community launch
**Rationale**: Network effects are crucial for location-based apps
**Impact**: Higher user engagement, organic growth, lower marketing costs
