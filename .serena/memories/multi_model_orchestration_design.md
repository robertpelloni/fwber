# Multi-Model AI Orchestration Design

## Current Capabilities Analysis
- **Codex MCP**: Supports session management, can maintain persistent coding context
- **Gemini MCP**: Has connection issues (ENOENT), needs configuration
- **Serena MCP**: Excellent memory system for coordination and context sharing
- **Sequential Thinking**: Maintains thought chains, good for complex reasoning

## Architecture Design
1. **Central Coordination Hub**: Serena MCP memory system
2. **Persistent Sessions**: Codex MCP for coding tasks
3. **Shared Context**: Memory files for each model's state and progress
4. **Task Distribution**: Round-robin or specialized assignment
5. **Conflict Resolution**: Voting/consensus mechanisms

## Implementation Strategy
- Use Serena memory as shared state management
- Create specialized memory files for each model's context
- Implement task queue system in memory
- Maintain persistent sessions across tool calls
- Use Sequential Thinking for complex coordination logic

## Benefits
- Leverages each model's strengths
- Maintains context across sessions
- Enables parallel processing
- Provides multiple perspectives on complex problems
- Creates collaborative AI system
